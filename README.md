ALGORITHMS AND PROBLEMS
-----------------------

See [algorithms site](https://dimalev.github.io/algorithms/) for more information.
Specially - on how do i use local scaffolding for faster and easier problem solving.

This is bunch of solved problems and clean algorithms to recall any of them.

Also it is a good place to train language proficiancy. C++, Java and Erlang - are
of my main interests.
