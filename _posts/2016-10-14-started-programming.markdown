Recently [started working][programming-root] on "Programming. Principles and Practice using C++".
See it's readme for details.

At first my interest fall on Matrix implementation which is described in the book in chapter 24.
More complecated implementation is presented in "C++ programming language" book, which is also 
on my (kindle) table.

Among others, this chapter contains type sizes descriptions, excersises and effects overview
(like overflow and precision loss). There is a drill asking to list sizes of types of your
compiler. I run this code on my old 32bit laptop, and recent android smartphone (blackberry
priv), and I got [fun results][sizes-results].
