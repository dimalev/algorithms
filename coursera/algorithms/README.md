Algorithms Courses
==================

Princeton Algorithms courses. They work with java, and use few tools to validate quality of the code.
These tools are collected and descripted in `tools/` folder.

They also use custom built classes to work with images, I/O and utilities. It also resides in `tools/`.

Course is built of two parts, hence two folders - `1/` and `2/`.
