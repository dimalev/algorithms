[Sherlock and the Dropping Ball](https://www.hackerrank.com/contests/101hack40/challenges/sherlock-and-dropping-ball) from hackerrank.

Given `N` lines segments on a plane which not intersect, and `q` balls (point) find `x` coordinate, where
balls will finaly fall into infinity. There is no horizontal or vertical segments.

Limitations
-----------

`1 <= N, q <= 10^5`, coordinates `-10^6 <= x, y <= 10^6`

Sample

Input

```
2 2
4 5 -5 0
3 2 7 -2
4 8
6 5
```

Output
