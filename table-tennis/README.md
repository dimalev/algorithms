Problem
-------

`N` people play table tennis. Each play once with every other. For each win player gets 2 point,
for loose - 1 point. You need to calculate probability of situation when all players have
different scores (no one has same score). You are given a `NxN` table with probabilities of win
for player in the row over player in the column.

Limitations
-----------

`2 <= N <= 10`

Input:
