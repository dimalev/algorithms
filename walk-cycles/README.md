Problem
=======

From first phone interview with booking.com. Given robots walk directions in the maze,
find all the loops in his path. Direction of walk are denoted as "^" for up, ">" for
right, "<" for left, and "v" for down.

Sample
------

Path "^<v>" - is a loop, robot walks in a small rectangle.
